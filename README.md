  ## Description
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, etc. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.
  ## Installation
  Fork and clone this repository. 
  Use `npm i` to install the dependencies.
  ## Usage
  After downloading from Github, run `node index.js` in your terminal. Follow the prompts and a README.md will be created.
